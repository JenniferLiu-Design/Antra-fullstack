A stored procedure is premade SQL code that you can save, so the code can be reused over and over again, saving time.

Unlike stored procedures, views do not accept parameters, cannot contain several statements, and cannot perform modifications on tables.

Functions must return values. Functions can only have input parameteres whereas Procedures can have input or output parameters. Functions can be called from Procedures but not vice versa.

Yes

Yes, as long as the stored procedure returns a result set.

Triggers are a database object. They are a type of stored procedure that is called when a command statement is executed. DDL, DML, CLR, and Logon are types of triggers.

Triggers help the database designer ensure certain actions are completed regardless of which program or user makes changes to the data. Triggers are mostly used for maintaining the integrity of the information on the database.

A stored procedure is a user defined piece of code written in the local version of PL/SQL, which may return a value (making it a function) that is invoked by calling it explicitly. A trigger is a stored procedure that runs automatically when various events happen (eg update, insert, delete).
